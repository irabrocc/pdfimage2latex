# PDF Diff Visualizer for LaTeX

This extension is developed with the help of an LLM. This readme.md file has the general idea of the extension while some data might be wrong. A VS Code extension that automatically detects visual differences between PDF versions of LaTeX documents and generates annotated comparison images directly in your project.

## Features

### 1. Smart PDF Comparison
- Automatically detects changes between `yourfile.pdf` and `yourfile_draw.pdf`
- Generates high-resolution difference images (default 300 DPI)
- Preserves document structure by analyzing text boundaries

### 2. LaTeX Integration
- Auto-inserts comparison figures at `%ANCHOR%` markers
- Maintains relative paths for cross-platform compatibility
- Supports multi-page document comparison

### 3. Intelligent Monitoring
- Real-time watching of both `.tex` and `.log` files
- File stability detection prevents premature processing
- Configurable cooldown period between checks


## Requirements

- **Python 3.8+** with these packages:
  ```bash
  pip install pymupdf opencv-python
  ```
- LaTeX distribution (TeX Live/MikTeX)
- VS Code 1.75+

## Extension Settings

Configure in `settings.json`:
```json
{
  "pdfDiff.pythonPath": "python",
  "pdfDiff.dpi": 300,
  "pdfDiff.maxRetries": 3,
  "pdfDiff.cooldownMs": 1000
}
```

## Usage

1. Add `%ANCHOR%` markers where you want difference images inserted
2. Save your `.tex` file to trigger comparison
3. View generated images in `./images/` directory

## Known Issues

- Large PDFs (>50MB) may require increased memory
- Complex layouts with overlapping elements may need manual adjustment
- First-run Python package installation may require VS Code restart

## Release Notes

### 1.1.0
- Added log file monitoring for more reliable PDF detection
- Implemented file stability checks
- Improved error handling

### 1.0.0
- Initial release with core comparison functionality

## Development Guide

### Building
```bash
npm install -g @vscode/vsce
vsce package
```

### Testing
1. Install the `.vsix` file via VS Code Extensions view
2. Open a LaTeX project with test PDFs

**Pro Tip**: Use `Ctrl+Shift+P` â†’ `Reload Window` after configuration changes.
